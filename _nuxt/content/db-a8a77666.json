When T-posed his wingspan is about 2.9 m, but his hands mostly hang down, so that does not affect potatoes. \nIf he is standing still, he would fit into a 1x1x2.75 m silo. In the terribly confusing metric system that is exactly 2.75 cubic meters, or in the superior Imperial system we can instantly see that 3.2 x 3.2 x 9 ft = ~97 cubic feet.\nDepending on size and lumpiness potatoes can range from about 42 to about 48 lbs per cubic foot. Since potatoes are not perfect cubes, some of the volume they fill is air, so I guess smaller more evenly-shaped potatoes weigh more than larger lumpier ones. If we assume a nice harvest of nice medium sized potatoes shaped closer to bricks than footballs, we can settle on 46 lbs / ft3.\nThis gives us 4,462lbs of potatoes to fill the same silo. We just gotta remember to crane Einar out first.","channel_id":"829113775876735026","author":{"id":"778788822771040257","username":"willt","avatar":"26d7b83aed09b13c95d9dae107409689","discriminator":"3754","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-06-03T21:36:01.278000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2021-06-03T21:36:43.494000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"hit":true},"dir":"/blueposts","path":"/blueposts/850125699272409119","extension":".json","createdAt":"2021-06-24T09:13:58.670Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-24T09:13:58.670Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1624526091845},"$loki":50},{"slug":"850127190367666247","type":"statement","message":{"id":"850127190367666247","type":0,"content":"We desperately really need a #potato-chat channel now","channel_id":"829113775876735026","author":{"id":"778788822771040257","username":"willt","avatar":"26d7b83aed09b13c95d9dae107409689","discriminator":"3754","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-06-03T21:41:56.783000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"hit":true},"dir":"/blueposts","path":"/blueposts/850127190367666247","extension":".json","createdAt":"2021-06-24T09:13:58.670Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-24T09:13:58.670Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1624526091845},"$loki":51},{"slug":"850127307419287612","type":"qna","messages":[{"id":"850126603970674708","type":0,"content":"Will this game  have some sort of economy ?","channel_id":"829113775876735026","author":{"id":"220232023753752578","username":"Isma","avatar":"d0695380d527e1dc243c09b58e886336","discriminator":"5123","public_flags":128},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-06-03T21:39:36.975000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[]},{"id":"850127307419287612","type":19,"content":"Some sort, for sure!","channel_id":"829113775876735026","author":{"id":"778788822771040257","username":"willt","avatar":"26d7b83aed09b13c95d9dae107409689","discriminator":"3754","public_flags":0},"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"mentions":[{"id":"220232023753752578","username":"Isma","avatar":"d0695380d527e1dc243c09b58e886336","discriminator":"5123","public_flags":128}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"timestamp":"2021-06-03T21:42:24.690000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"message_reference":{"channel_id":"829113775876735026","message_id":"850126603970674708"},"hit":true}],"dir":"/blueposts","path":"/blueposts/850127307419287612","extension":".json","createdAt":"2021-06-24T09:13:58.670Z","updatedAt":"2021-06-24T09:13:58.670Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1624526091845},"$loki":52},{"slug":"850127536519774220","type":"qna","messages":[{"id":"850124254741790761","type":0,"content":"Conversation in the other channel gave me a thought.

There will be a very very small number of other special invites split among content creators, investors, partners, etc, but this is from a separate budget and they may not even have as complete access to the pre-alpha compared to the 1400 (still figuring this out). Remember the main goal here is to test the game and get feedback, so we need as many players like yourselves as possible. BUT we are also talking to content creators because they have a completely separate set of needs for the game that we need *their* feedback on. So we have to make sure we get a diverse set of opinions from that group as well. Hopefully that helps
