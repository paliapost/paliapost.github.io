        Everything on this site (design, functionality, content) is temporary.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page you can see all posts from the devs. It gets updated once a day.
        I don't filter anything, I don't categorize. So currently it's total chaos in
        here.I just automated stalking the devs in their
        <a href="https://discord.com/invite/playpalia">Discord Server</a>
        and then post everything here.
      </p>

        I started this project because:
        <ul>
          <li>
            I wanted an easiert way to keep track of the blueposts (i.e. posts form the
            devs on their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/playpalia">Discord Server</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            I always wanted to abuse an API
          </li>
          <li>
            While it looks like a very simple homepage, it allowed me to check out some
            tech I wanted to check out for some time.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Automatically assign tags and categorization
      </li>
      <li>
        A more condensed form of the information. Mini articles for each topic
        of interest.
      </li>
      <li>
        More filter options. Especially by date/day.
      </li>
      <li>
        Newsletter with new posts.
