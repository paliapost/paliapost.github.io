We're going to be moving to weekly Q&As. \n\n**What does this mean?**\nThe posting cadence from the team might be less during the week or they'll probably just chime in on easy to answer questions.\n\n**Why are you locking the team away from us?!?!**\nWell the main reason is that we have a game to build! There's still a few things we need to get ready before the Pre-Alpha (that starts *so* *soon*). A weekly Q&A gives the team the peace of mind that they'll still be hearing from you and sharing info with you, while also letting them focus on their work.\n\n(Also I'm not really locking them! I promise no devs will be harmed in this process.)\n\n**When will questions be sent to the team?**\nI'll be collecting the questions on the channel on Wednesday. Remember, just because a question was asked doesn't mean it will necessarily be answered. As we've said a few times already, there are somethings we aren't ready to discuss just yet (so please be patient with us).\n\n**When will the questions be answered?**\nI plan on having the answers on Thursday. Please bear with us because there's quite a few of you, and I suspect we might get more questions than we can reasonably answer during that time.", "channel_id": "809857031116685348", "author": {"id": "786370144120209478", "username": "Neleimour", "avatar": "a_e45fb561aa69f58bd9b9e4cc587a503e", "discriminator": "6254", "public_flags": 0}, "attachments": [], "embeds": [], "mentions": [], "mention_roles": [], "pinned": false, "mention_everyone": false, "tts": false, "timestamp": "2021-06-07T01:22:05.653000+00:00", "edited_timestamp": null, "flags": 1, "components": [], "hit": true}}
