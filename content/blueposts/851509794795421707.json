I'm a game developer and game academic (Michigan State University). Mostly my partner and I have been working on \"Friendship Games\" and that was one of the things that made Palia jump out at us. We have been doing research around relationships through games and in particular how some games do it better / worse. We are really interested in folks who are being intentional in making games that foster new friendships/connections (Sky for mobile is an interesting recent example). But, we are curious if the devs would / could talk about what mechanics, tools or systems they see as being integral to Palia for developing (good/better) community and relationships? We are working on a paper now that discusses League of Legends and WoW (WoW over time really...) and other games in relation to these topics and would love to talk about Palia and what y'all doing different. Hope it is ok to <@!786370144120209478> with this one.
