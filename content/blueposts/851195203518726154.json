We're going to be moving to **weekly Q&As**. \n\n**What does this mean?**\nThe posting cadence from them might be less during the week or they'll probably just chime in on easy to answer questions.\n\n**Why are you locking the team away from us?!?!**\nWell the main reason is that we have a game to build! There's still a few things we need to get ready before the Pre-Alpha (that starts *so soon*). A weekly Q&A gives the team the peace of mind that they'll still be hearing from you and sharing info with you, while also letting them focus on their work.\n\n(Edit: Also I'm not really locking them! I promise no devs will be harmed in this process.)\n\n**When will questions be sent to the team?**\nI'll be collecting the questions on the channel on Wednesday. Remember, just because a question was asked doesn't mean it will necessarily be answered. As we've said a few times already, there are somethings we aren't ready to discuss just yet (so please be patient with us).\n\n**When will the questions be answered?**\nI plan on having the answers on Thursday. Please bear with us because there's quite a few of you, and I suspect we might get more questions than we can reasonably answer during that time.", "channel_id": "829113775876735026", "author": {"id": "786370144120209478", "username": "Neleimour", "avatar": "a_e45fb561aa69f58bd9b9e4cc587a503e", "discriminator": "6254", "public_flags": 0}, "attachments": [], "embeds": [], "mentions": [], "mention_roles": [], "pinned": true, "mention_everyone": false, "tts": false, "timestamp": "2021-06-06T20:25:50.961000+00:00", "edited_timestamp": "2021-06-06T20:28:07.916000+00:00", "flags": 0, "components": [], "hit": true}}
