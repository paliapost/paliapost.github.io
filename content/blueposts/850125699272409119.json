When T-posed his wingspan is about 2.9 m, but his hands mostly hang down, so that does not affect potatoes. \nIf he is standing still, he would fit into a 1x1x2.75 m silo. In the terribly confusing metric system that is exactly 2.75 cubic meters, or in the superior Imperial system we can instantly see that 3.2 x 3.2 x 9 ft = ~97 cubic feet.\nDepending on size and lumpiness potatoes can range from about 42 to about 48 lbs per cubic foot. Since potatoes are not perfect cubes, some of the volume they fill is air, so I guess smaller more evenly-shaped potatoes weigh more than larger lumpier ones. If we assume a nice harvest of nice medium sized potatoes shaped closer to bricks than footballs, we can settle on 46 lbs / ft3.\nThis gives us 4,462lbs of potatoes to fill the same silo. We just gotta remember to crane Einar out first.", "channel_id": "829113775876735026", "author": {"id": "778788822771040257", "username": "willt", "avatar": "26d7b83aed09b13c95d9dae107409689", "discriminator": "3754", "public_flags": 0}, "attachments": [], "embeds": [], "mentions": [], "mention_roles": [], "pinned": false, "mention_everyone": false, "tts": false, "timestamp": "2021-06-03T21:36:01.278000+00:00", "edited_timestamp": "2021-06-03T21:36:43.494000+00:00", "flags": 0, "components": [], "hit": true}}
