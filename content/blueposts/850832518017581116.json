You need a 'song line' for the instrument to record and if another player in a radius of x-metres joins the 'Music-Play' and he has the track learned he can join the Musical-Group.\n\nJust by this you have 100 different SKills you could learn.\n\nIts a concept which is also affordable to develop in a game and not too hard.

It all comes down to priorities, too. It's not merely \"do we make a music playing feature\" or not, it's choosing to do it versus something else, and the many many many knock on effects. Maybe a naive implementation ends up annihilating server performance? What if all the network traffic for that ends up doubling server costs in practice? What about people intentionally being a noise nuisance to others?
