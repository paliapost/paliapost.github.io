Some tech artists are more shader specialists, or tools and pipeline, or tech systems, etc. While a tech artist generally specializes in one category we end up working on all these different aspects of the game. My main responsibilities are making the systems that allow the world to feel alive, that entails working on the shaders but also the script and code needed to control and support the feature I'm working on. I'm also responsible for the performances of the environment, I need to make sure that while it looks good and feels alive it needs to be able to run on our defined platforms.
