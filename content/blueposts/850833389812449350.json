It all comes down to priorities, too. It's not merely \"do we make a music playing feature\" or not, it's choosing to do it versus something else, and the many many many knock on effects. Maybe a naive implementation ends up annihilating server performance? What if all the network traffic for that ends up doubling server costs in practice?
