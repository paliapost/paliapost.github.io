Will there be a form of competition for them? Will players be able to build everywhere? How would you prevent players from littering the game world with unused buildings, or making rudimentary 'not really safe for work' pixel art with them (or make areas look like a minecraft server where the main building tools were wood, obsidian and dynamite)? Are you considering splitting the community by instancing building areas? If so, how would you guarantee a community feeling when the community would be split up? Whatever happens i hope that last thing won't happen (see wow for why).", "channel_id": "829113775876735026", "author": {"id": "152508224627671040", "username": "Khrome", "avatar": "58531ef4639d7ecec6bac6ae9250ede4", "discriminator": "9024", "public_flags": 0}, "attachments": [], "embeds": [], "mentions": [], "mention_roles": [], "pinned": false, "mention_everyone": false, "tts": false, "timestamp": "2021-06-04T00:20:38.669000+00:00", "edited_timestamp": "2021-06-04T00:20:55.474000+00:00", "flags": 0, "components": []}, {"id": "850167370889953301", "type": 19, "content": "Currently our housing is instanced off in private spaces - there will be ways for players to show off their plots but it will not be so free [edit - as running by someone's home].
